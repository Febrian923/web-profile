            I'm Ragil Putra Febriansyah, and I call the vibrant city of Malang, Indonesia, my home. 
            I am a passionate learner, currently pursuing my higher education at Universitas Merdeka Malang, 
            where I'm on a journey to expand my knowledge and explore new horizons. Alongside my college studies, 
            I'm also dedicated to personal growth and skill development through my participation in the Bangkit Academy.
          </p>
          <p>
            This program allows me to sharpen my skills and stay at the forefront of technological advancements, 
            helping me shape a brighter future. I believe in the power of continuous learning and look forward to contributing 
            positively to my community and beyond.

            <h2>Hobby</h2>
            <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/myprofile-website/assets/image/basket.jfif" class="featured-image" alt="geografis" />
            <p>
              Basketball is more than just a hobby for me; it's a passion that fuels my enthusiasm and keeps me active.
              The thrill of dribbling the ball down the court, the sound of sneakers squeaking on the hardwood, 
              and the camaraderie with teammates make basketball an integral part of my life. Whether it's a friendly 
              pickup game at the local park or a competitive league match, I find joy in every aspect of the sport. 
              Not only does basketball provide an excellent physical workout, but it also teaches valuable life lessons such 
              as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. The sound of the ball swishing through the net is music to my ears, 
              and every time I step onto the court, I am reminded of the magic that this sport brings into my life.

            <p>
              In addition to basketball, I'm also a big fan of anime. It's a hobby that I enjoy for its diverse storytelling, 
              unique characters, and captivating animation styles. Whether it's a classic series or a new release, 
              I find watching anime to be a fun and immersive experience that allows me to appreciate the art of storytelling 
              and animation.

            <p>
              Besides my interests in basketball and anime, I also have a knack for making short videos. 
              I find joy in creating and sharing brief, visually engaging clips that capture moments, stories, 
              or simply showcase my creative side. It's a hobby that lets me experiment with visual storytelling 
              and editing, and I love the way it allows me to express my creativity in a different and exciting way.
